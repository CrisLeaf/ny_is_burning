# Time Series Analysis For New York Temperature

In this project, we tried to fit different time series models to the New York Maximum and 
Minimum temperature data.

## Requirements

The program was written using a Python 3.9 environment, and the following libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)


## Dataset

The data was obtained using the 
[NCEI API Service](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation).

On the terminal, run
```
get_data.py
```
to get the complete dataset.


## Results

We explored different Auto Regressive models, finally fitting one that gave us an Absolute Error 
of 2-3 Â°K.

Run
```
graphs.py
```
to get some basic temperature estimation.

As an example, we got:

## Graphs
You can also get some trend graphs by running
```
graphs.py
```
on terminal. They are the following:

<img src="plots/temp2.png"/>
